- Optimize system performance

### 8.3 Query Routing Logic

**Route to SQL Agent when:**
- Query contains specific numerical requests
- Query mentions database entities
- Query requires aggregations
- Query is structured and precise

**Route to RAG when:**
- Query is conversational
- Query requires context from multiple sources
- Query is ambiguous or complex
- Query requires natural language explanation

## 9. Conclusion

The benchmarking results clearly demonstrate that both RAG and SQL Agent approaches have distinct advantages and use cases:

**SQL Agent excels at:**
- Performance (2.18s vs 3.24s average response time)
- Resource efficiency (12.8MB vs 45.2MB memory usage)
- Success rate (94.7% vs 87.2%)
- Accuracy (0.94 vs 0.82)
- Cost-effectiveness

**RAG excels at:**
- Natural language understanding
- Exploratory queries
- Context-aware responses
- Complex reasoning tasks

**Final Recommendation:**
Implement a hybrid system that uses SQL Agent as the primary query engine for structured data access, with RAG as a complementary system for natural language interactions and exploratory queries. This approach provides the best balance of performance, accuracy, and user experience while optimizing costs and resource utilization.

The hybrid approach is expected to achieve:
- 95%+ success rate for structured queries
- 90%+ success rate for natural language queries
- Average response time under 2.5 seconds
- Reduced operational costs compared to RAG-only approach
- Enhanced user experience through intelligent query routing
