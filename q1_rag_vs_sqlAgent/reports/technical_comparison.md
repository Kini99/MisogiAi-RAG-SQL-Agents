# Technical Comparison: RAG vs SQL Agent for E-commerce Customer Support

## Executive Summary

This report provides a comprehensive technical analysis comparing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and SQL Agent approaches for enabling natural language queries in an e-commerce customer support system. Both approaches offer distinct advantages and trade-offs that make them suitable for different use cases and scenarios.

## 1. Technical Architecture Comparison

### 1.1 RAG System Architecture

**Components:**
- **Document Processing**: Converts database records into searchable documents
- **Vector Embeddings**: Uses sentence transformers to create semantic representations
- **Vector Database**: ChromaDB for storing and retrieving document embeddings
- **Retrieval Engine**: Semantic search to find relevant documents
- **Generation Model**: OpenAI GPT-4 for generating natural language responses
- **Response Synthesis**: Combines retrieved documents with LLM generation

**Data Flow:**
1. Database records → Document conversion → Text chunking
2. Chunks → Embedding generation → Vector storage
3. Query → Embedding → Similarity search → Document retrieval
4. Retrieved documents + Query → LLM → Natural language response

**Strengths:**
- Handles natural language queries effectively
- Provides context-aware responses
- Can answer complex, multi-faceted questions
- Good for exploratory queries and customer interactions

**Limitations:**
- Requires preprocessing of all data into documents
- May not provide precise numerical results
- Limited to information present in the document corpus
- Higher computational overhead for real-time queries

### 1.2 SQL Agent Architecture

**Components:**
- **Natural Language Parser**: Converts queries to SQL intent
- **Schema Understanding**: Maps query concepts to database schema
- **SQL Generator**: Creates executable SQL queries
- **Query Executor**: Runs SQL against PostgreSQL database
- **Result Formatter**: Converts database results to natural language
- **Error Handler**: Manages SQL generation and execution errors

**Data Flow:**
1. Natural language query → Intent extraction
2. Intent + Schema → SQL generation
3. SQL → Database execution → Raw results
4. Raw results → Formatting → Natural language response

**Strengths:**
- Provides precise, accurate numerical results
- Leverages existing database indexes and optimizations
- Can handle complex aggregations and joins
- Real-time access to current data

**Limitations:**
- Requires structured database schema
- May struggle with ambiguous or complex natural language
- Limited to SQL-expressible queries
- Requires careful prompt engineering for reliable SQL generation
